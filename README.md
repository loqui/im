COQUI Instant Messenger
=====

COQUI is based in LOQUI Instant Messenger is a mobile chat app for Firefox OS that allows you to use your Hangouts™ or Jabber® account.

How does it work? (It does!)
====
It uses a great javascript library for performing XMPP communication which is called "Strophe.js".
Strophe is capable of connecting to any XMPP server listening trough BOSH (Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP).

Currently all connections are made through the open BOSH gateway at http://app.loqui.im/http-bind but soon the app should be able to detect wether user's account provided has its own BOSH server and connect to it and if not, connect to a open BOSH from its country.

In longer term, connections should be made through javascript TCPSockets API, avoiding the need for BOSH servers and thus improving performance and reliability.
